31	US blogger fired by her airline  A US airline attendant suspended over "inappropriate images" on her blog - web diary - says she has been fired
  Ellen Simonetti, known as Queen of the Sky, wrote an anonymous semi-fictional account of her life in the sky
 She was suspended by Delta in September
 In a statement, she said she was initiating legal action against the airline for "wrongful termination"
 A Delta spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday that Ms Simonetti was no longer an employee
 Delta has repeatedly declined to elaborate on what it calls "internal employee matters"
 A spokesperson reiterated this position on Wednesday, confirming only that Ms Simonetti was no longer with the company
 The spokesperson also confirmed that there were "very clear rules" attached to the unauthorised use of Delta branding, including uniforms
 Ms Simonetti announced on her blog she had been fired on 1 November
  She said in an official statement: "As a result of my suspension and subsequent termination without cause by Delta Airlines I am moving forward with filing a discrimination complaint with the Federal Government EEOC [US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]
" She added she had also hired a Texas-based law firm to initiate legal action for "wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages
" Ms Simonetti told the BBC News website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 September
 Queen of the Sky has received a lot of support and advice from the global blogging community since news of her suspension was brought to light on the BBC News website and others
  Her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites
 The blog, which she started in January as a way of getting over her mother's death, contains a mix of fictional and non-fictional accounts
 Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right, according to Ms Simonetti
 In the postings, she made up fictional names for cities and other companies she mentioned to protect anonymity
 But some postings contained images of herself in uniform
 Of the 10 or so images only one showed Ms Simonetti's flight "wings"
 She removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension
 "I never meant it as something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them," Ms Simonetti said
 A legal expert in the US speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images were posted
  Delta has been hit recently by pressures of rising fuel costs and fierce competition
 It has said it needs to cut between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs and reduce costs by $5bn (2
7bn) a year
 Analysts had warned recently that the airline might have to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy prevention
 Last week, it struck a $1bn cost-cutting deal with its pilots which could save it from bankruptcy
 The deal would see pilots accept a 32% pay cut in return for the right to buy 30 million Delta shares, unions said
 And on Monday, it negotiated a deal to defer about $135m in debt which was due next year, until 2007
 The airline also said it had agreed the terms of a $600m loan from American Express
 
32	US duo in first spam conviction  A brother and sister in the US have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to AOL subscribers
  It is the first criminal prosecution of internet spam distributors
 Jurors in Virginia recommended that the man, Jeremy Jaynes, serve nine years in prison and that his sister, Jessica DeGroot, be fined $7,500
 They were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk e-mails using fake addresses
  They will be formally sentenced next year
 A third defendant, Richard Rutkowski, was acquitted
 Prosecutors said Jaynes was "a snake oil salesman in a new format", using the internet to peddle useless wares, news agency Associated Press reported
 A "Fed-Ex refund processor" was supposed to allow people to earn $75 an hour working from home
 Another item on sale was an "internet history eraser"
 His sister helped him process credit card payments
 Jaynes amassed a fortune of $24m from his sales, prosecutors said
 "He's been successful ripping people off all these years," AP quoted prosecutor Russell McGuire as saying
 Jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100,000 e-mails in 30 days, Virginia State Attorney General Jerry Kilgore reportedly said
 Prosecutors had asked for 15 years in jail for Jaynes, and a jail term for his sister
 But Jaynes' lawyer David Oblon called the nine-year recommended term "outrageous" and said his client believed he was innocent
 He pointed out that all three of the accused lived in North Carolina and were unaware of the Virginia state law
 Spam messages are estimated to account for at least 60% of all e-mails sent
