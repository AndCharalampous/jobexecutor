34	Apple sues to stop product leaks  Computer firm Apple has issued a lawsuit to prevent online leaks of information about future products
  The lawsuit, against an unidentified individual, comes just weeks before the MacWorld conference in San Francisco, used to showcase new products
 The complaint said an "unidentified individual


 has recently misappropriated and disseminated confidential information"
 The lawsuit was filed with the Santa Clara California Superior Court
 Apple is famously secretive about its future product launches while Apple users are equally famous for speculating about new technology from the company
 Fans have speculated in recent weeks about the possibility of a new type of iPod being announced at the MacWorld conference
  Apple said in the seven-page complaint, filed on 13 December, that it did not know the "true names or capacities, whether individual, associate, corporate or otherwise," of the defendants
 The company said it would amend the complaint once they had discovered the names of those who had allegedly leaked information
 It is not the first time Apple has sued people who have posted information about future products on the internet
 In December 2002, Apple sued a former contractor who allegedly posted online drawings, images and engineering details of the company's PowerMac G4 computer
 In a statement, Apple said of the current lawsuit: "Apple has filed a civil complaint against unnamed individuals who we believe stole our trade secrets and posted detailed information about an unannounced Apple product on the internet

35	UK broadband gets speed injection  Broadband's rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch
  An eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider UK Online
 It is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband TV
 The service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use BT's exchanges and will initially only be available in towns
  It represents a "big leap forward" for broadband, said Chris Stening, UK Online general manager
  The service comes with a hefty 39
99 monthly price tag but will mean users can download MP3s in seconds and offers TV-quality video streaming
 The service includes WiFi as standard, meaning users can connect multiple PCs, laptops and game consoles from any room in the house
 Not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service, as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas
 The service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as London, Birmingham, Glasgow and Cambridge
 That represents about 4
4 million households
 The service is possible due to a decision to loosen BT's strangle-hold on telephone exchanges
  The process, known as local loop unbundling, was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog Oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs
 UK Online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls, video-on-demand and TV by 2005 if the service proves popular
 "The service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the UK and 16 times faster than most broadband services," said Mr Stening
 "It takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it," he said
 Countries such as South Korea and France have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband
 In South Korea, video-on-demand over the net is cheaper than renting a DVD and online gaming is huge
 Mr Stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi-occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments
 "A typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a 512 kilobit service
 This will basically give them 2 megabits each," he said
