44	When invention turns to innovation  It is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past
  When history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people's lives substantially
 But, says Nick Donofrio, senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at IBM, it was not "the thing" itself that actually improved people's lives
 It was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it
 The car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities, giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs, whilst having mobility and access
 "When we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st Century, we have to think more like this, but faster," Mr Donofrio told the BBC News website, after giving the Royal Academy of Engineering 2004 Hinton Lecture
 "The invention, discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had
 "The equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered, but by themselves, they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did
" These are not altogether new ideas, and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years
 But what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them
  We are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues Mr Donofrio, Industry Week's 2003 Technology Leader of the Year
 The hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work, make sense, make a difference and life gets better as a result
  "In the dotcom era, there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes
 "Somebody had a new thing that would awe you
 You weren't quite sure that it did anything, you weren't quite sure if you needed it, you weren't quite sure if it had value for it, but it was cool
" But change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be "in your face"
 It will creep in pervasively
 Nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways, through new superconducting materials, to coatings, power, and memory storage
 "I am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure," says Mr Donofrio
 Pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules, and where jewellery, clothes, and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires, screens and keyboards
 The net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there, like air
 "People will not have to do anything to stay connected
 People will know their lives are just better," says Mr Donofrio
 "Trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know
" Natural interfaces will develop, devices will shape your persona, and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances
  Ultimately, there will be, says Mr Donofrio, no value in being "computer illiterate"
 To some, it sounds like a technological world gone mad
 To Mr Donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen
 Behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and "deep computing", says Mr Donofrio
 Deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data, and integral to this concept is supercomputing
 It has value, according to IBM, because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions, like how to refine millions of net search results, finding cures for diseases, or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates
  But pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world
 As computing and technologies become part of the environment, part of furniture, walls, and clothing, physical space becomes a more important consideration
  This is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience
 "I am confident that the SET [science, engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills," he says
 "If I am right about what innovation is, you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative
 "Women tend to have those traits a lot better than men
" Eventually, women could win out in both life and physical sciences, he says
 In the UK, a DTI-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40% representation on SET industry boards
 IBM, according to Mr Donofrio, has 30%
 "Our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career
" The whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to Mr Donofrio
 "We believe in the whole issue of global diversity," he says
 "Our customers are diverse, our clients are diverse
 They expect us to look like them
 "As more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions, it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them

45	BT program to beat dialler scams  BT is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams, which can cost dial-up net users thousands
  From May, dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on a user's "pre-approved list"
 Inadvertently downloaded by surfers, rogue diallers are programs which hijack modems and dial up a premium rate number when users log on
 Thousands of UK dial-up users are believed to have been hit by the scam
 Some people have faced phone bills of up to 2,000
 BT's Modem Protection program will check numbers that are dialled by a computer and will block them if they have not been pre-approved, such as national and net service provider numbers
 Icstis, the UK's premium rate services watchdog, said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives
 "The initiatives are very welcome," a spokesperson from Icstis told the BBC News website
 "We are very pleased to see they are putting into place new measures to protect consumers
"  The second initiative BT announced is an early warning system which will alert BT customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills
 If a bill rises substantially above its usual daily average, or if a call is made to a suspect number, a text or voice alert will be sent to the user's landline phone
 As part of the clamp-down on rogue diallers, companies must now satisfy stringent conditions, including clear terms and conditions, information about how to delete diallers and responsibility for customer refunds
 Any firm running a dialler without permission can now be closed down by Icstis
 The watchdog brought in the action last October following a decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services
  There are legitimate companies who offer services such as adult content, sports results and music downloads by charging a premium rate rather than by credit card BT said it had ploughed an enormous amount of effort into protecting people from the problem
 It has already barred more than 1,000 premium rate numbers and has tried to raise public awareness about the scams
 "We now want to ensure there are even stronger safeguards for our customers, who we would urge to make use of these new options to protect themselves," said Gavin Patterson, group managing director for consumer the arm of BT
 Both schemes have been undergoing trials in Ireland, and will be made available to 20 million BT customers from May
 
46	Internet boom for gift shopping  Cyberspace is becoming a very popular destination for Christmas shoppers
  Forecasts predict that British people will spend 4bn buying gifts online during the festive season, an increase of 64% on 2003
 Surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising, as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online
 Savvy shoppers are also using the net to find the hot presents that are all but sold out in High Street stores
  Almost half of the UK population now shop online according to figures collected by the Interactive Media in Retail Group which represents web retailers
 About 85% of this group, 18m people, expect to do a lot of their Christmas gift buying online this year, reports the industry group
 On average each shopper will spend 220 and Britons lead Europe in their affection for online shopping
  Almost a third of all the money spent online this Christmas will come out of British wallets and purses compared to 29% from German shoppers and only 4% from Italian gift buyers
 James Roper, director of the IMRG, said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as LCD television sets and digital cameras
 Mr Roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for Christmas
 He advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular
 A survey by Hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents, such as lingerie, for wives and girlfriends
 Much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time, according to research carried out by security firm Saint Bernard Software
 The research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer
 Worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket, suggests the research, who will spend up to five hours per week in December browsing and buying at online shops
  Iggy Fanlo, chief revenue officer at Shopping
com, said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping
 "When you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher," he said
 Higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster, he said, which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy
  The behaviour of online shoppers was also changing, he said
 "The single biggest reason people went online before this year was price," he said
 "The number one reason now is convenience
" "Very few consumers click on the lowest price," he said
 "They are looking for good prices and merchant reliability
" Consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service
 Data collected by eBay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site
 According to eBay UK there are now more than 150 Robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site
 The Robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores
 Similarly many shoppers are turning to eBay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline PlayStation 2, which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle
 The high demand for the PlayStation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up
 In shops the PS2 is supposed to sell for 104
99
 In some eBay UK auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure
 Many people are also using eBay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country
 The portable version of the PlayStation has only just gone on sale in Japan yet some enterprising eBay users are selling the device to UK gadget fans
