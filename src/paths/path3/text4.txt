5	Telewest to challenge Sky Plus  Cable firm Telewest is to offer a personal video recorder (PVR) in a set -top box to challenge Sky Plus
  Sky Plus is the market leader in the field of digital video recorders in the UK, with 474,000 subscribers
 PVRs record TV programmes to a hard drive, letting viewers pause, and rewind live television and effectively "time shift" the viewing experience
 A number of PVRs incorporating Freeview digital terrestrial TV are also on the market but their success is limited
 Telewest's PVR will offer a 160GB hard drive, which has storage for up to 80 hours of programmes
 The box has three tuners, which means viewers can record two channels simultaneously while watching a third channel
  Sky Plus boxes come in two versions - a 20GB version for 99 and a 160GB version for 399
 Sky also charges a 10 subscription fee to the service, unless viewers have a subscription to one of its premium packages
 Telewest has yet to reveal pricing for the new box or if it will be charging a subscription fee for the service
  Eric Tveter, president and chief operating officer at Telewest Broadband, said: "We will make our PVR set-top box available later this year, putting a stop to missed soaps, interrupted films and arguments over which programmes to record
" PVRs and recordable DVD players are set to replace video recorders as the standard method of recording and saving favourite TV programmes
 Last year, high street retailer Dixons said it was going to stop selling VHS machines in favour of PVRs and recordable DVD machines
 Sky has said it aims to have 25% of its subscribers using Sky Plus by 2010 - it is predicting 10 million total subscribers by that date
 It currently has 7
4 million subscribers, while Telewest provides digital cable to 1
7 million customers
 
6	Norway upholds 'Napster' ruling  A Norwegian student who ran a website which linked to downloadable MP3 files has been ordered to pay compensation by the country's Supreme Court
  Frank Allan Bruvik was ordered to pay 100,000 kroner (8,000) to the music industry in Norway
 He was a student when he set up his napster
no site, which allowed users to submit and receive links to MP3 files
 Bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after a lower court had found for the music industry
 Music industry bosses in Norway said the ruling would help build confidence in the internet as a distribution medium
  Frank Allan Bruvik set up the napster
no website as part of a school project in 2001 while studying computer engineering in the Norwegian town of Lillehammer
 The website was not associated with the napster
com site in the USA, which had been operating since 1999 and was already facing legal action
  Bruvik's site was online between August and November 2001, and while it did not host any music, at its peak it was providing links to more than 170 free files on other servers
 As well as providing links, the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors
 A legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including Norway's performing rights society, Tono, and the Norwegian branches of Sony Music and Universal Music, who saw it as an important test of principle
  A Norwegian court ruled in 2003 that Bruvik would have to pay 100,000 kroner to the music industry, but the country's Court of Appeal cleared him, saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music
 However, the Supreme Court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law It added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act, and that Bruvik's actions were premeditated
 Norway's music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling, because showed that music piracy would not be accepted
  Meanwhile, in the USA a further 717 lawsuits against people alleged to have traded copyrighted songs were filed this week by the Recording Industry Association of America
 The suits, brought on behalf of the major record companies, cite the individuals for illegally distributing music via unauthorized peer-to-peer services such as KaZaa and eDonkey
 As with preceding cases, the fresh action was made against so-called "John Doe" defendants, who are identified only by the codes given to their computers' internet connections
