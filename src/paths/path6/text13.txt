  A US researcher has suggested that games such as The Sims could be a good way to teach languages
 Ravi Purushotma believes that the world of The Sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods
 The inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said Mr Purushotma
  There must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework
 But instead of fearing computer games, Ravi Purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games
 "One goal would be to break what I believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional," he said
 He believes that the "phenomenal ability" of games such as The Sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation
 The hard part of learning any language, said Mr Purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences
 Boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be
 "The way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity," he said
  By contrast, said Mr Purushotma, learning via something like The Sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all
 This was because The Sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players
 Instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on
 The incidental information about what a Sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said Mr Purushotma
 By contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context
 For instance, he said, in a version of The Sims adapted to teach German, if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word "energie" the actions of a tired Sim, stumbling then falling asleep, would illustrate the meaning
 If necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players' or students' understanding
  One of the drawbacks of The Sims, said Mr Purushotma, was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation
 However, online versions of The Sims, in which people have to move in, meet the neighbours and get to know the local town, could be adapted to help this
 Although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, Mr Purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help
  Getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes
 Before now, he said, educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games
 But, he said, using pre-prepared game worlds such as The Sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game
 This could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons
 "I'm hoping now to re-create a well-polished German learning mod for the sequel by this summer," he told the BBC News website
 "I'm encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with Japanese and Spanish
" Earlier work with a colleague on using Civilisation III to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society's problems can not always come from making a single change
 A report on the experiment said: "Students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play, using geography and history as tools for their game, and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play
" Mr Purushotma's ideas were aired in an article for the journal Language Learning and Technology
 
27	Search sites get closer to users  Search sites want to get to know you better
  Not content with providing access to the millions of websites, many now offer ways that do a better job of remembering, cataloguing and managing all the information you come across
 Some of the latest to update their search systems are Ask Jeeves and Blinkx, which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web
 "The future is all about developing your own personal web," said Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves
  Mr Macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it, because there was no memory of what they had searched for before
 "Each time you go back in you have to start all over again," he said
 The series of updates to its service, collected under the My Ask Jeeves banner, would help people remember where they had been before
  Ask Jeeves has added the ability to "save" websites of interest so the next time a users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found
 Sites saved in this way can be arranged in folders and have notes attached to them to explain why they were saved
 Mr Macklin said many people wanted to save sites they had seen but did not want to add them to their bookmarks or favourites not least because such lists cannot be easily searched
 On average, said Mr Macklin, users conduct between five and 10 searches per day and the tools in My Ask Jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily
 Under My Ask Jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting
 "It's about finding again what you found before," he said
 The My Ask Jeeves service lets people store up to a 1000 web links or 5000 if they sign up to the free service
 By way of comparison Google's Desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited
  At the same time, search start-up Blinkx has released a second version of its eponymous software
 Blinkx is desktop search software that watches what someone is working on, be it a document or e-mail, and suggests websites, video clips, blogs or documents on a PC that are relevant to it
  Since Blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as Google, Copernic, Enfish, X1 and Apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their PC as well as the web
 "The competition has validated the problem we tackle," said Suranga Chandratillake, co-founder of Blinkx
 In the latest release of Blinkx, the company has added what it calls smart folders
 Once created the folders act as persistent queries that automatically sweep the web for pages related to their subject and catalogues relevant information, documents or incoming e-mails, on hard drives too
 What users do with Blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines
 "Blinkx users do not stop using other web search systems," he said
 "They might use Google to look up a company, or Yahoo for travel because they know they are good at that," he said
 "The classic thing we have seen recently, is people using Blinkx to look at the things they have searched on," he said
 The variety of ways to search data was only helping users, said Mr Chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks
