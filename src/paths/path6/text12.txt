23	Sony PSP console hits US in March  US gamers will be able to buy Sony's PlayStation Portable from 24 March, but there is no news of a Europe debut
  The handheld console will go on sale for $250 (132) and the first million sold will come with Spider-Man 2 on UMD, the disc format for the machine
 Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan
 The console (12cm by 7
4cm) will play games, movies and music and also offers support for wireless gaming
 Sony is entering a market which has been dominated by Nintendo for many years
  It launched its DS handheld in Japan and the US last year and has sold 2
8 million units
 Sony has said it wanted to launch the PSP in Europe at roughly the same time as the US, but gamers will now fear that the launch has been put back
 Nintendo has said it will release the DS in Europe from 11 March
 "It has gaming at its core, but it's not a gaming device
 It's an entertainment device," said Kaz Hirai, president of Sony Computer Entertainment America
 
24	Hi-tech posters guide commuters  Interactive posters are helping Londoners get around the city during the festive season
  When interrogated with a mobile phone, the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home
 Sited at busy underground stations, the posters are fitted with an infra-red port that can beam information directly to a handset
 The posters are part of Transport for London's Safe Travel at Night campaign
  The campaign is intended to help Londoners, especially women, avoid trouble on the way home
 In particular it aims to cut the number of sexual assaults by drivers of unlicensed minicabs
 Nigel Marson, head of group marketing at Transport for London (TfL), said the posters were useful because they work outside the mobile phone networks
 "They can work in previously inaccessible areas such as underground stations which is obviously a huge advantage in a campaign of this sort," he said
  The posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an IR port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster
 "We started with infra-red because there are a huge number IR phones out there," said Rachel Harker, spokeswoman for Hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters
 "It's a well established technology
" Hypertag is also now making a poster that uses short-range Bluetooth radio technology to swap data
 Although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number, Ms Harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images, ring tones and video clips
 She said that there are no figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign run for a cosmetics firm racked up 12,500 interactions
 "Before we ran a campaign there was a big question mark of: 'If we build it will they come?'" she said
 "Now we know that, yes, they will
" The TfL campaign using the posters will run until Boxing Day
 
25	Mobile networks seek turbo boost  Third-generation mobile (3G) networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services
  That was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes last week
 Fast 3G networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, says the Global Mobile Suppliers Association
 At 3GSM, Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data
 The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3G networks
 The system is not available commercially yet, but Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now
 Early HSDPA systems typically offer around two megabits per second (Mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (Kbps) on standard 3G networks
  "High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) - sometimes called Super 3G - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips," according to a report published by UK-based research consultancy Analysys
 A number of companies are developing the technology
 Nokia and Canada-based wireless communication products company Sierra Wireless recently agreed to work together on High Speed Downlink Packet Access
 The two companies aim to jointly market the HSDPA solution to global network operator customers
  "While HSDPA theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14Mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks," said Dr Alastair Brydon, author of the Analysys report: Pushing Beyond the Limits of 3G with HSDPA and Other Enhancements
 "The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity


 when compared to basic WCDMA [3G]," he added
 Motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2
9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device
 But some mobile operators are opting for a technology called Evolution, Data Optimised (EV-DO)
  US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3G network at the end of last year
 We are "expanding our network and deploying EV-DO technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds," said Oliver Valente, Sprint's vice president for technology development, when the contract was announced
 As part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year, Sprint will spend around $1bn on EV-DO technology from Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Motorola that provides average data speeds of 0
3-0
5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2
4Mbps
 MMO2, the UK-based operator with services in the UK, Ireland and Germany, has opted for technology based on HSDPA
 Using technology from Lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3
6Mbps from next summer on its Isle of Man 3G network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14
4Mbps
 US operator Cingular Wireless is also adopting HSDPA, using technology from Lucent alongside equipment from Siemens and Ericsson
  Siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but Christoph Caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: "By the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10
" Siemens - in collaboration with the Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one
 This enables a data transmission, such as sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band
 The speeds offered by 3G mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3G licences
 But today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial-up phone connection, many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0
5 megabits a second - much faster than 3G
 This means users are likely to find 3G disappointing unless the networks are souped up
 If they aren't, those lucrative "power users", such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks, reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators
 But one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately
 Siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory, it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials
 A commercial system could be as far away as 2012, though Siemens did not rule out an earlier date
