  The Santy worm first appeared on 20 December and within 24 hours had successfully hit more than 40,000 websites
 The malicious program exploits program a vulnerability in the widely used phpBB software
 Santy's spread has now program been stopped after Google began blocking infected sites searching for new victims
  The worm replaces chat forums program with a webpage announcing that the site had been defaced by the malicious program
 Soon after being infected, sites hit by the worm started randomly searching for other websites running the vulnerable phpBB software
 Once Google started blocking these search queries the rate of infection tailed off sharply
 A message sent to Finnish security firm F-Secure by Google's security team said: "While a seven hour response for something like this is not outrageous, we think we can and should do better
" "We will be reviewing our procedures to improve our response time in the future to similar problems," the Google team said
 Security firms estimate that about 1m websites run their discussion groups and forums with the open source phpBB program
 The worst of the attack now seems to be over as a search conducted on the morning of the 22 December produced only 1,440 hits for sites showing the text used in the defacement message
 People using the sites hit by Santy will not be affected by the worm
 Santy is not the first malicious program to use Google to help it spread
 In July a variant of the MyDoom virus slowed down searches on Google as the program flooded the search site with queries looking for new e-mail addresses to send itself to
 
12	Halo 2 heralds traffic explosion  The growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company Sandvine
  It issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the Xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of Halo 2
 The 9 November traffic explosion has continued into December, said Sandvine
 Service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth
 As well as being a popular single-player title, Halo 2 can be connected to Microsoft's subscription-based broadband network, Xbox Live
 Gamers who want to play online can create their own clan, or team, and take on others to see how well they compare
  But the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said Sandvine's chief technology officer Marc Morin
  In a bid to cope and ease congestion, providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent, finding out who is using bandwidth and for what
 It could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use
 "The explosion in Xbox Live traffic attributed to Halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call," he said
 "ISPs need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games," he added
  One of the main factors that spoils online gaming is "lag" in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world
 Gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest "lag"
 Analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said Lindsay Schroth, an analyst with research firm The Yankee Group
 "In the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming," she said
 In countries such as Korea, which has high levels of fast net connections to homes, online gaming is hugely popular
 
13	EU software patent law faces axe  The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented
  Politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law
 During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped
 The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile
  Hugo Lueders, European director for public policy at CompTIA, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper
 He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents
 Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software
 But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement
 The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament
 Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it
 Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs
 To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill
 The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration
