  Music, images, e-mails, and texts are being hoarded on mobiles, cameras laptops and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), a Toshiba study found
 It found that more than 60% kept 1,000 to 2,000 music files on their devices, making the UK "digitally fat"
 "Virtual weight" measurements are based on research by California Institute of Technology professor Roy Williams
 He calculated physical comparisons for digital data in the mid-1990s
 He worked out that one gigabyte (1,000,000,000 bytes) was the equivalent of a pick-up truck filled with paper
 The amount of data people are squirreling away on their gadgets is clearly a sign that people are finding more things to do with their shiny things
  If digital hoarding habits continue on this scale, people could be carrying around a "digitally obese" 20 gigabytes by next year
 "Britain has become a nation of information hoarders with a ferocious appetite for data," said Martin Larsson, general manager of Toshiba's European storage device division
  "As storage capabilities increase and the features and functionalities of mobile devices expand to support movie files and entire libraries of multi-media content, we will all become virtually obese," he told the BBC News website
 The survey reflects the increasing trend for portable devices with built-in hard drives like music and media players from Apple, Creative Labs, Archos, iRiver and others
 This trend is set to grow, according to analysts
 They suggest the number of hard drives in consumer electronics gadgets could grow from 17 million last year to 55 million in 2006
 "Consumers are driving the move towards smaller devices that have greater functionality, and industry is trying to keep up," said Mr Larsson
 "People are looking for more than just phone calls and text messages on the move, they want things like web browsing, e-mailing, music, photos and more
"  Many are finding memory keys and memory sticks are simply not big enough to hold everything
  "Floppies and memory keys have their place, but they don't have anything like the capacity or flexibility of a hard drive so are unable to meet the demand for more and more storage capacity in consumer devices," said Mr Larsson
 The cost of making hard drives has dropped and is continuing to do so because of improved technologies so they are proving to be more cost-effective than other forms of memory, he added
 The amount of data that can be stored has grown by 400% in the last three years, while the cost for every gigabyte has fallen by 80%
 It is also getting easier to transfer files from one device to another, which has traditionally been a slow and problematic area
 "Transfer of data between different memory types has improved significantly in recent times, and will be further helped by the standards for hard drives which are currently being developed by the major manufacturers," said Mr Larsson
 According to technology analysts IDC, a fifth of all hard drives produced will be used in consumer electronics by 2007
 
42	'Friends fear' with lost mobiles  People are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends
  More than 50% of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years
 More than half (54%) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm Intervoice said that they do not have another address book
 A fifth rely entirely on mobiles
 About 80% of UK adults own at least one mobile, according to official figures
 It is estimated that 53% of over 65s own a mobile, according to Intervoice, but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34
  Most 15 to 24-year-olds (94%), and 25 to 34-year-olds (92%), own at least one
 Nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts' information again if the phone was lost, stolen or replaced
  The survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book
 Many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details, and with people changing their phones once a year on average, it becomes a problem
 They also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart, relying on the mobile phone book instead
 "We're a nation of lazy so-and-sos," David Noone from Intervoice said
 "We put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can't be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book
 "The mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart
" One in three women, the survey said, thought if they lost their phones, it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether
 Most (62%) said they had no idea what their partner's number was
 Mr Noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves
  Generally, information from Sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards, or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software
 Sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds
  But some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too
 Orange told the BBC News website that those with Orange Smartphones could use the My Phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online
 For non-smartphone users, a Memory Mate card could be used to back up data on the phone
 O2 also offers a free, web-based syncing service which works over GPRS and GSM
 Neither Vodafone or T-Mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups, but encourage people to use Sim back-up devices
 It is thought that about 10,000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50% of total street crime involves a mobile
 Mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year
 Globally, more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004, 26% more than the previous year, according to analysts
 It is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005
 
43	Gates opens biggest gadget fair  Bill Gates has opened the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, saying that gadgets are working together more to help people manage multimedia content around the home and on the move
  Mr Gates made no announcement about the next generation Xbox games console, which many gadget lovers had been hoping for
 About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1
5 million square feet and runs from 6 to 9 January
 The latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies will all be on show over the three days
  Mr Gates said that a lot of work had been done in the last year to sort out usability and compatibility issues between devices to make it easier to share content
  "We predicted at the beginning of the decade that the digital approach would be taken for granted - but there was a lot of work to do
 "What is fun is to come to the show and see what has been done
 It is going even faster than we expected and we are excited about it
" He highlighted technology trends over the last year that had driven the need to make technology and transferring content across difference devices "seamless"
 "Gaming is becoming more of a social thing and all of the social genres will use this rich communications
 "And if we look at what has been going on with e-mail, instant messaging, blogging, entertainment - if we can make this seamless, we can create something quite phenomenal
"  Mr Gates said the PC, like Microsoft's Media Centre, had a central role to play in how people would be making the most out of audio, video and images but it would not be the only device
 "It is the way all these devices work together which will make the difference," he said
 He also cited the success of the Microsoft Xbox video game Halo 2, released in November, which pushed Xbox console sales past PlayStation in the last two months of 2004 for the first time in 2004
 The game, which makes use of the Xbox Live online games service, has sold 6
23 million copies since its release
 "People are online and playing together and that really points to the future," he said
 Several partnerships with device and hardware manufacturers were highlighted during Mr Gates' speech, but there were few major groundbreaking new technology announcements
 Although most of these affected largely US consumers, the technologies highlighted the kind of trends to come
 These included what Mr Gates called an "ecosystem of technologies", like SBC's IPTV, a high-definition TV and digital video recorder that worked via broadband to give high-quality and fast TV
 There were also other deals announced which meant that people could watch and control content over portable devices and mobile phones
  CES features several more key speeches from major technology players, such as Intel and Hewlett Packard, as well as parallel conference sessions on gaming, storage, broadband and the future of digital music
 About 50,000 new products will be unleashed at the tech-fest, which is the largest yet
 Consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers the CEA on Tuesday
 The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004
 That trend is predicted to continue with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005
