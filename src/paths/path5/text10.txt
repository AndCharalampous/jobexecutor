  A survey carried out by PC Pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab
 The tests found that images from top PC printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs
 But using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months, warned the magazine
  The group test of 100 home photo printers for PCs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as High Street names such as Jessops, Boots and Snappy Snaps
 The comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images, the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage
 It found that although some ink for printers now costs more than 2 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a High Street store
 "If you really like your photos, then it's definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street, but only if you choose the right printer," said Nick Ross, top tester at PC Pro
  Mr Ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many High Street developers or even some professional wedding photographers
 Some High Street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in, said Mr Ross, but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home
 According to PC Pro, producing a print 8x10in on an Epson R800 printer using top quality paper costs 1
87
 At Jessops the same image would cost 2
50 and at Snappy Snaps 9
99
 A 10x7in snap at Boots would cost 4
99
 "Considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the High Street and how silver-halide prints can fade in the sun, we're adamant that it's now better, cheaper and more convenient to print at home," he said
 Ann Simpson, marketing manager at Snappy Snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers
 "Some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one," she said
 "Many people are not skilled at getting the colour, contrast and cropping right and they don't want the hassle," she added
 The magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading
 It recommended avoiding so-called third-party inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest
 
18	Consumer concern over RFID tags  Consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says
  More than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags, which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses
 Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases
 The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low
 The survey of consumers in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini
 The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology
 The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number
  More than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases
 Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties
 Ard Jan Vetham, Capgemini's principal consultant on RFID, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology
 "Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns
 "With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point
" He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items
 The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items
 They are also in use as a passcard for the M6 Toll in the Midlands, in the UK
 Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance
 He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology
 At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing
 All kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned
